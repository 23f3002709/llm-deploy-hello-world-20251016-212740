# Hello World â€¢ Bootstrap 5 Single-Page App

A minimal, production-ready single-page web application that displays "Hello World" using an H1 element with id="greeting". Built with Bootstrap 5 via CDN, it is fully static and suitable for GitHub Pages deployment.

## Features
- Simple and clear UI using Bootstrap 5 (CDN)
- Self-contained: inline CSS and JavaScript, no build step required
- Embedded assets via data URIs (logo, favicon)
- Professional, responsive layout
- Graceful error handling and clean, maintainable code
- Works as a fully static site (GitHub Pages compatible)

## Setup / Deployment
- No build or server is required.
- To run locally: simply open `index.html` in your browser.
- For static hosting: upload the files to any static host (e.g., GitHub Pages). The repository created by this deployment already enables GitHub Pages.

## Usage
- Open the page and verify the greeting shows "Hello World!" in the H1 with `id="greeting"`.
- Click the "Check Status" button to see an example interactive message.

## Technical Overview
- Libraries: Bootstrap 5 (CSS and JS via CDN)
- Structure:
  - `index.html`: Single, self-contained page with inline CSS and JavaScript
  - No external build tools or dependencies
- Data URIs: Logo and favicon are embedded as data URIs in JavaScript and applied on page load.
- Accessibility: Basic features like skip link and ARIA live region for status updates.

## Code Quality Notes
- Inline JS uses `try/catch` for initialization, and small helper functions for safe DOM access.
- Minimal global surface: a small `window.app` object is provided for debugging/testing.
